- create rule to hide/show/color selection
- draw relations & nodes with tags
- draw name tags on map?
- allow saving current selection to osm
- on pan draw only new parts
- draw wide roads/ line/fill styles
- empty or/and should act as disabled
- disabled rule should not be evaluated at all
- read multiple files
- start without cmdline args and open file from menu
- read shapefiles?


--- general ideas ----

store attribs as tags (with some way to be able to recognise them) this is 4 bytes less on each object, which is quite a lot considering the sheer nr of nodes
